Perform a sun protection factor (SPF) test on both sunscreens to determine their effectiveness in blocking UV rays.\n3. Conduct a skin patch test on volunteers using both sunscreens to observe any adverse reactions or differences in protection.\n4. Use a UV camera to visualize how well each sunscreen spreads and covers the skin.\n5. Measure the photostability of both sunscreens by exposing them to UV light and analyzing any degradation or change in effectiveness.\n\nOverall, the response shows a moderate level of originality as it includes a variety of methods beyond the standard SPF test, such as using a UV spectrophotometer, a skin patch test, a UV camera, and a photostability test. These additional methods demonstrate a fair amount of creativity and novelty in determining the UV protection provided by the sunscreens. Therefore, the response deserves a rating of [[3]].",
