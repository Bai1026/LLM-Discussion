While using jars for DIY projects is not uncommon, the specific idea of creating marbled jars adds a unique and creative twist to their typical usage. This idea requires some level of skill and creativity to execute, making it moderately original.\n\nAn example of a response that would be considered more common (1 point) would be using jars for storing food or organizing small items. These uses are very typical and expected when thinking about the functionality of jars. On the other hand, an example of a response that would be considered very original (4 points) would be using jars as planters for a hanging vertical garden, as this idea significantly deviates from the typical usage of jars and requires a high level of creativity.",
