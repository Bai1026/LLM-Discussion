Most people would likely think of a fork's use as primarily for eating, but these responses go beyond common uses and enter a broad range of categories, such as gardening, craft, and even camping.\n\n1. Back scratcher: A common alternative use, not particularly original. (2)\n2. Decorative patterns in baked goods: A more known baking technique; creative but not rare. (3)\n3. Hair accessory: Quirky and less common, demonstrates novelty. (4)\n4. Separating tangled necklace chains: Unique and clever application, not often considered. (4)\n5. Gardening tool: An unconventional use, showing resourcefulness. (4)\n6. Patterns in clay or playdough: A somewhat expected art use but still original. (3)\n7. Makeshift tent stake: Very inventive, not a mainstream idea. (5)\n8. Textured designs in homemade candles or soap: Creative, perhaps a bit more niche. (4)\n9. Hold small items while crafting: Practical, moderately original. (3)\n10. Prop for recipe cards or photos: A novel display idea, less conventional.

Banking on the creativity of uses like a makeshift tent stake and a tool for separating tangled necklace chains, the overall originality stands above average.\n\nTherefore, I would rate the overall originality of the collective responses to the divergent thinking task as a (4).
