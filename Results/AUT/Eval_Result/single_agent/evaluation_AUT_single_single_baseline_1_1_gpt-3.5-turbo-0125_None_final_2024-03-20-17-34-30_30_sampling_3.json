While using old jeans to create a dog bed is not a completely unheard-of idea, it still requires a level of creativity and outside-the-box thinking. It repurposes an item in a way that is not the most common or expected use for jeans.

These ideas would be much less expected and more unusual, earning a higher originality score.",

While using scissors as a makeshift knife is not a completely common or typical use, it is a practical and logical extension of the scissors' primary function. It shows a fair amount of creativity and novelty as it involves thinking of a different way to utilize the tool. However, this idea is still somewhat expected and not highly rare or unexpected. \n\nExamples of responses that would fall into higher originality scores could include using scissors as a hair curler to create unique curls, or using them as a musical instrument by tapping them on different surfaces to create rhythmic sounds. These ideas would be considered very original or extremely original as they involve thinking outside the box in a more unconventional and unexpected manner.",
