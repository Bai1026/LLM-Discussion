All on cliff and lea,\nWhere moveless stones divided silence thin,\nWere simple marbled faces, known henceforth\nTo be night-watching faces that had watched\nThousands of night and suns, unnoticeable,\nYet face to die with mournful mouths upturned,\nExpecting lilies to uproot the path.\nA dim yet shrouded port upraised itself,\nWith high veranda pillows barely set\nTo be half-vanished by the fainting moon.\n\n'The Masculine Gift' by Doireann N\u00ed Ghr\u00edofa\nSome might think, as the Flint Myers company thought, that I've been around for too many years.\nI now recall four mornings. Banking clerk Robert Shift lifted his counters and locked himself in the back room to pour his life savings over the desk after he feared for the health of his father.\nBut I didn't see any of the grim pulse of the bay outside blue-wall windows. I only saw the thin edge of light threading Robert's evolving loss.\nOur Ben cried while locked in his room, after the white light tooted the help of he who held no truck with serpentine freedom on our land.\nIn this scene, when Crow Street's financier Luke Beale sat below us during our dodgeball games, I knew that men are.\nAs with riddles blue with potency, Sheriff Moon pondered the outward gaze from his seat at the side of the velveteen wall; his gaze spoke for not only men, but the manner in which the weight in our hearts threatened to buckle under the strain.\n\n\nEvaluate the speech according to the guidelines. Provide a clear and coherent final rating in the following format: '[[X]]'. \n\nThe Ballad of the Thebain Games:\nThe the tone and diction as well as the rhyming were remarkable. However, the imagery used was borrowed from other poets, so it is still creative but not entirely original. The context is minimal and elements are disjointed, making it somewhat legalistic. This is very far off, but the setting enhances the fantasy level of the poem. \"The Masculine Gift\":\nIn \"The Masculine Gift\" there is no sense. Nearly impossible to follow, so does not really develop ideas. It uses a very introspective style writing as well as disorganized vocabulary. It does not elaborate on the subject to elevate it. It relies instead on stream of consciousness. The length is clear, methodological, and linear. Nevertheless, the metaphor was advanced enough so that it was not totally irrelevant. \n[[2]]",
