This response shows a high level of creativity and innovation by repurposing the sheet into something entirely different and practical. It also promotes sustainability by offering an alternative to traditional gift wrapping materials. This idea is unexpected and not commonly considered, making it a very original use of a sheet. \n\nIn contrast, a response that would be considered a 2 or 3 in originality could be using a sheet as a picnic blanket or as a makeshift curtain. While these ideas are somewhat creative and show slight variations from typical uses, they are still relatively common and not as unique or innovative as creating fabric gift bags.",
