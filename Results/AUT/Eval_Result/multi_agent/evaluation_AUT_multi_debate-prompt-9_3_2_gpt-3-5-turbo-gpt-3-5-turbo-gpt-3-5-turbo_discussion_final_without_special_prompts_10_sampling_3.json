This use of a fork goes beyond its typical function of just being a utensil for eating, and incorporates it into a completely different realm of crafting and design. It requires out-of-the-box thinking and shows innovation in repurposing everyday items for unconventional purposes. This idea is unexpected and not commonly thought of, making it a very original response. \n\nExamples of responses that would be rated lower include using a fork to eat food (1 point) or using a fork to stir sauces (2 points). These are more common uses of a fork that are not as original or creative as the leather or fabric stamping idea.",
