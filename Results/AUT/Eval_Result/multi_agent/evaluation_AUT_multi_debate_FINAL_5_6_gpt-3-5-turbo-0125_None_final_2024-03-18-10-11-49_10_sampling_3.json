While using a mug as a personalized drinking glass is not a completely common or mundane idea, it is not extremely rare or unexpected either. Many people have personalized mugs by adding their names, designs, or quotes to them, making it a somewhat familiar concept. However, the creativity lies in the suggestion to use permanent markers or decals for personalization, showcasing a fair amount of creativity and novelty.\n\nFor example, a more common use for a mug would be for drinking coffee or tea, which is a very typical and expected function of this item. On the other hand, a highly original idea would be something completely unconventional, like using a mug as a planter for small succulents or converting it into a mini herb garden.

While using a blanket for storytelling or as a mat is a somewhat common use, the idea of turning it into an interactive storytelling mat by drawing story maps or scenes on it is very original.

While using a scarf as a decorative cover for journals or notebooks is not a common or mundane suggestion, it also isn't an extremely unique or rare idea. It displays creativity by repurposing the scarf in a way that adds a personal touch to everyday items. However, it doesn't reach the level of being significantly unique or unexpected. \n\nTo provide an example at a lower level, a very common response would be using a scarf to keep warm in cold weather. This is a typical and expected use for a scarf. \n\nOn the other hand, an example of a response that would be considered very original would be using a scarf as a creative way to hang and display art pieces on a wall, providing a unique and visually appealing gallery-like effect. This idea goes beyond the typical uses of a scarf and demonstrates a high level of creativity and innovation. \n\nTherefore, the response suggesting using a scarf as a decorative cover for journals or notebooks has a fair amount of creativity and novelty, earning it a score of 3.",
