While using mirrors in a gym or home workout space is not necessarily a new or groundbreaking idea, it is a practical and creative way to utilize a mirror for a specific purpose beyond its traditional use for personal grooming or home decor. The suggestion to use mirrors to improve workout form and technique demonstrates a fair amount of creativity and a different perspective on the typical use of mirrors. \n\nFor comparison:\n- A very common response would be using a mirror for personal grooming such as applying makeup or styling hair.\n- A somewhat common response would be using a mirror for home decor to make a space look larger or brighter.\n- A very original response would be using a mirror as a creative art piece by incorporating it into a sculpture or installation.\n- An extremely original response would be using a mirror as part of a psychological experiment to study self-perception and identity. \n\nOverall, the suggestion to use mirrors for checking workout form falls within the range of moderately original due to the specific and practical application it offers.",
