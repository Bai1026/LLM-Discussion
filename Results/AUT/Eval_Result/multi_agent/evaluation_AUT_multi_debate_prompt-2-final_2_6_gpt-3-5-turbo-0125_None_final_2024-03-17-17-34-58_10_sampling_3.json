While customizing a blanket with tassels, fringe, or embroidery is a creative idea that adds a personal touch and makes it a statement piece, it is not entirely rare or unexpected. Many people personalize their textiles like blankets by adding these decorative elements, making it a somewhat common practice. However, it does show creativity in thinking beyond just using the blanket for warmth or comfort. \n\nAn example of a response that would fall under a 4 or 5 in originality could be something like \"Turn a blanket into a hammock by attaching it to a sturdy frame and adding cushioning for support.\" This idea involves a high level of innovation and uniqueness, as it transforms the standard use of a blanket into something entirely different and unexpected.",

While the idea of using a scarf as a headrest cover for added comfort is not necessarily common, it is a practical and somewhat expected use for a scarf in certain situations like traveling.

While using a scarf as a decorative ribbon for wrapping gifts is not a completely unique idea, it does show a fair amount of creativity and novelty. While scarves are often worn as clothes or accessories, using them in this way adds a new dimension to their utility. It's not the most typical use for a scarf, making it somewhat original. \n\nIn comparison, very common uses for a scarf might include wearing it around the neck for warmth or using it as a fashion accessory. On the other hand, a very original use for a scarf could be using it as a curtain tieback or turning it into a makeshift bag. Since the response falls somewhere in between these extremes, a score of 3 for moderate originality seems appropriate.",

While using a scarf as a decorative table runner is not a completely common idea, it is still within the realm of typical alternative uses for scarves. This response shows some creativity in repurposing the scarf in a non-traditional way, but it is not highly rare or unexpected. \n\nFor comparison:\n- A response like \"Use a scarf as a makeshift belt for a dress\" would be considered somewhat common (2) as it's a slightly more inventive use but still falls within typical alternative uses for scarves.\n- On the other hand, a response like \"Create a unique piece of wall art by framing several scarves together\" would be rated as very original (4) as it introduces the scarf as a medium for creating artwork, which is a less expected use. \n\nIn summary, the response \"Turn a scarf into a decorative table runner by layering different colored scarves for a unique look\" falls in the moderately original category as it presents a creative idea that is not completely common but doesn't venture into highly unique or unexpected territory.",
