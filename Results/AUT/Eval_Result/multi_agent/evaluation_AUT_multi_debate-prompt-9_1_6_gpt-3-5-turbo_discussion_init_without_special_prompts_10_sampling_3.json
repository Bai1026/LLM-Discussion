While turning a ring into a wearable accessory by attaching it to a bracelet or necklace is not a commonly thought of use for a ring, it does show some creativity in repurposing the item in a unique way. While it may not be extremely original, it demonstrates a fair amount of creativity by thinking outside the typical use of a ring as jewelry for fingers. \n\nFor example, some less original uses for a ring would include wearing it on a finger, using it as a keychain accessory, or using it as a napkin ring. On the other hand, a very original use for a ring could be repurposing it as a mini picture frame by inserting a tiny photo into the setting to create a personalized piece of jewelry.",
