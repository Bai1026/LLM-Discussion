While using a jar as a smudge stick holder is a creative idea that demonstrates some novelty and uniqueness, it is not an extremely rare or unexpected use for a jar. Many people use jars for storage purposes, so using it specifically for smudge sticks adds a level of creativity but is not highly uncommon. An example of a very original response could be using the jar as a terrarium for miniature plants, which is a more unexpected and unconventional use. In comparison, using the jar as a smudge stick holder falls into the moderately original category.",
