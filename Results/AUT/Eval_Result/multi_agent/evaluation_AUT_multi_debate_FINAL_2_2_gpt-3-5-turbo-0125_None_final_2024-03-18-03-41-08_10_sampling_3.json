While it may not be the most common or expected use for a blanket, it does show creativity and innovation in utilizing the blanket for added comfort in a different way. This idea demonstrates a fair amount of creativity and novelty, as it involves repurposing the blanket for a new function beyond its typical use for warmth. It falls into the category of moderately original because while it is not commonly thought of, it also isn't highly rare or unexpected.\n\nFor comparison:\n- If someone had suggested using a blanket as a picnic blanket, that would be a very common idea and may only receive a score of 1.\n- If someone had suggested using a blanket as a makeshift curtain by hanging it over a window, that would be somewhat common and may receive a score of 2.\n- If someone had suggested using a blanket as a hammock by suspending it between two trees, that would be very original and may receive a score of 4.\n\nBased on the criteria and examples provided, the response of turning a blanket into a cozy seat cushion warrants a score of 3 for its moderately original and creative use.",
