While repurposing a guitar as a utensil holder is not a common use, it still falls under the category of repurposing the item for storage purposes, which is a relatively common creative idea. It shows a fair amount of creativity in thinking outside the box to use the guitar in a practical way. However, it is not a highly unique or unexpected concept. For example, another response that would be considered more original could be turning the guitar into a bird feeder by adding a platform for bird food on the strings, which is a less common and more innovative use.",

While using a teddy bear as a door hanger is not a completely unique or unheard-of concept, the added element of attaching a message or reminder written on a tag hanging from its arm adds a creative and personalized touch to the idea. This adds a level of customization and functionality to the traditional use of a teddy bear, making it more creative than just displaying it as a decorative item. Overall, this idea strikes a good balance between novelty and practicality, earning it a score of 3.",
