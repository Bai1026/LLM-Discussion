While using a ring as a keychain is a slightly creative twist on the typical use of a ring, it is a somewhat expected or common idea that has been seen before. It shows a basic level of creativity by repurposing the ring for a different function, but it is not highly unique or innovative. \n\nTo illustrate:\n- A more common use of a ring would be wearing it on your finger as jewelry.\n- A more creative and less common use could be using a ring as a napkin holder at a dinner party, showcasing a new and unexpected way to utilize the item.",
