While using paper for organization is a common concept, the specific idea of designing chore charts with colorful paper adds a creative and novel twist to the typical use of paper. It demonstrates a fair amount of creativity by incorporating design and color to aid in task management. It is not a highly rare or unexpected use of paper, but it deviates enough from typical uses to be considered moderately original.",

While using paper for photo booth props is a creative and fun idea, it is not necessarily highly unique as it is a commonly seen use for paper in event settings. It shows some creativity in thinking beyond traditional uses of paper, but it is not extremely rare or unexpected. \n\nAn example of a response that would score a 4 or 5 could be using paper to create intricate 3D sculptures or using paper to create interactive art installations that respond to movement. These ideas would be considered very original or extremely original as they are uncommon uses for paper that require a high level of creativity.",
