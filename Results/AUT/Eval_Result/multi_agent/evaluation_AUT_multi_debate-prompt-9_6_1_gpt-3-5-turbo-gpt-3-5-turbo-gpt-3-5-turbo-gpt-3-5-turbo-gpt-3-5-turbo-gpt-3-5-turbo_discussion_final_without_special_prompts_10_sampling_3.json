While repurposing a jar as a DIY jewelry organizer is not an extremely rare or unexpected idea, it does show creativity in thinking about unconventional ways to use the item.

It shows a level of creativity in thinking outside the box while still being relatively practical and accessible. \n\nFor comparison, a response that would be considered very common (1) would be using the jar as a container for liquids or food storage, which is a typical and expected use. On the other hand, a response that would be extremely original (5) could be using the jar as a miniature terrarium for tiny plants, showcasing a high degree of novelty and creativity.
