While terrariums in jars are not uncommon, adding the unique twist of a mermaid theme makes this idea moderately original. It shows that the participant is thinking beyond typical terrarium designs and incorporating a playful and imaginative element. \n\nFor comparison:\n- A common response (1 point) would be using a jar as a container for storing liquids or food, which is a very typical and expected use.\n- A somewhat common response (2 points) would be using a jar as a vase for flowers, which although slightly different from the typical use, is still a common and conventional idea.\n- A very original response (4 points) might be using a jar as a mini greenhouse for growing specific plants, showing significant uniqueness and creativity compared to standard uses.",
