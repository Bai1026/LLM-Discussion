While using a mug as a photo display is not a common use, it still aligns with the general idea of using a container for display purposes.

It is not a highly rare or unexpected use, but it deviates from the typical function of a mug for holding beverages. \n\nAn example of a response that would be considered Very Original or Extremely Original could be something like using the mug as a mini indoor plant pot, converting it into a pencil holder, or even transforming it into a candle holder.

While using a scarf as a picnic blanket strap is not a commonly thought-of use, it still involves utilizing the scarf in a somewhat practical manner.

However, it is not a completely rare or unexpected idea as it involves a straightforward application of the item. Therefore, a score of 3 is appropriate for this response. \n\nTo provide further context, a Very Original use of a scarf could be using it as a makeshift curtain in a rustic setting, adding a touch of elegance and creativity to the decor.
