While hanging framed artworks or photographs from the racket frame may not be a common idea, it is not entirely unexpected or rare. This idea shows a creative twist on repurposing the item for a decorative purpose. However, it falls short of being considered highly unique or significantly innovative. \n\nFor comparison:\n- A response suggesting using the racket as a makeshift musical instrument by plucking the strings could be considered somewhat common, as it is a variation of a typical use but not highly original. (2 points)\n- On the other hand, a response proposing turning the racket into a jewelry holder by attaching hooks for necklaces and earrings would be more original as it is a unique and unexpected use of the item.
