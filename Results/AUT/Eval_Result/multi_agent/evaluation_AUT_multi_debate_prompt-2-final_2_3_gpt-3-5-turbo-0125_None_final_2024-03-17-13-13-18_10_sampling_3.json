While using a scarf to tie around a bouquet of flowers is not a commonly thought of use for a scarf, it also isn't entirely unexpected or out of the ordinary. It shows a fair amount of creativity by repurposing the scarf in a decorative way that is outside of its typical use. However, it is not as unique or innovative as responses that would fall under the very original or extremely original categories. An example of a very original or extremely original response could be using a scarf as a makeshift bag strap or harness for a small pet.",
