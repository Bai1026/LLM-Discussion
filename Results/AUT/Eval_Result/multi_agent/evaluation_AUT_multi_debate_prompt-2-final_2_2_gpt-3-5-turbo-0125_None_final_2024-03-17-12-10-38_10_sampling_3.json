While hanging a blanket on the wall is not a common use, it is not extremely rare or unexpected. This idea shows a fair amount of creativity and novelty as it transforms the blanket into a decorative element rather than its typical function of providing warmth. However, it is not so unique that it would be considered a very original or extremely original idea.\n\nFor comparison:\n- Using a blanket as a tablecloth would be somewhat common (2 points) as it is a slightly unconventional use but still falls within the realm of expected alternatives.\n- Turning a blanket into a makeshift fort would be very original (4 points) as it is a unique and imaginative use that goes beyond typical applications of a blanket.",
