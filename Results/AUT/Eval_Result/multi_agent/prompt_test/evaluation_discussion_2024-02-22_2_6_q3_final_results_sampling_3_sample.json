This shows a significant level of creativity in thinking outside the box and applying mirrors in a unique way. Reflective therapy environments could involve using mirrors to help individuals reflect on themselves, their thoughts, and emotions, making it a rare and innovative use of a mirror. Some more common uses of mirrors include checking one's appearance, decorating a space, or enhancing lighting. The suggestion of using mirrors in reflective therapy environments adds a new dimension to how mirrors can be utilized.",
