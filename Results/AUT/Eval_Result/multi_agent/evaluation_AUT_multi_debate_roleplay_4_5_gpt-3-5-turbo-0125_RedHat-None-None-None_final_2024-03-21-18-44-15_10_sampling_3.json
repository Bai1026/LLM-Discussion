While using gloves as a hair styling assistant is not a common or mundane suggestion, it also isn't an entirely unique or groundbreaking concept. It shows creativity in repurposing gloves for a specific and practical use in hairstyling. However, it falls short of being considered very original or extremely original as it is a feasible yet not widely known application of gloves. \n\nAn example of a very original idea could be using gloves as a plant watering system by attaching small tubes to the fingertips to release water directly to the roots of plants, enabling precise and efficient watering. This idea is highly unique and innovative, as it involves a completely unexpected use of gloves.\n\nAn even more extreme example of originality could be using gloves as a musical instrument by affixing bells or other noise-making objects to each finger, allowing the wearer to create unique sound patterns by moving and shaking their hands.
