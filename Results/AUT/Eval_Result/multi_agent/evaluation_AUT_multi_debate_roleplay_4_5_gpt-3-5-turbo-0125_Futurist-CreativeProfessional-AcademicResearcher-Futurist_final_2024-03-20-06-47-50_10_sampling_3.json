While utilizing a mug for holding hot beverages is a common and expected use, repurposing it as a scented wax warmer shows a creative twist on its functionality. While this idea may not be highly rare or unexpected, it certainly goes beyond the typical uses of a mug and showcases a moderate level of originality. \n\nFor example, if someone listed using a mug as a flower vase or a pencil holder, those would be considered somewhat common uses, as they are slight variations from the expected use of holding a beverage. On the other hand, if a participant suggested using a mug as a mini herb garden or a hanging bird feeder, those would be viewed as very original ideas, as they significantly diverge from the traditional uses of a mug and introduce innovative concepts.",
