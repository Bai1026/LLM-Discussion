While using jars for storage is a common idea, the specific use of a DIY root vegetable storage solution is a bit more unique and creative. It shows some level of novelty and creativity by repurposing a jar for a specific type of food storage, which is not the most typical use of a jar. \n\nOn the other hand, storing food items in jars is a widely known practice, so it doesn't reach the level of being significantly unique or unexpected.

While using a scarf as a hair tie is not a common use, it has been seen before and is a somewhat creative way to repurpose the item. It shows a fair amount of creativity and novelty in thinking of alternative functions for a scarf beyond its typical use for warmth or fashion around the neck. However, it is not a highly rare or unexpected idea as it is a relatively common suggestion in fashion and DIY circles. \n\nFor comparison, a very original idea could be using a scarf as a makeshift belt for a dress or using it as a decorative piece in a frame for wall art. An extremely original idea could be repurposing a scarf as a table runner for a unique table setting or using it as a decorative headboard for a bed. These suggestions would be much less common and more unexpected, earning a higher originality score.",
