Using a blanket as a door draft stopper is a creative and practical use that may not immediately come to mind for everyone. While it's not necessarily a commonly thought of use for a blanket, it also isn't an entirely unique or groundbreaking idea either. This response falls into the category of fair creativity and novelty, as it shows some outside-the-box thinking but is still within the realm of practicality and common sense. \n\nSome examples of responses that would fall into the lower originality categories include using a blanket as a bed cover (1) or using it as a wrap for warmth (2), as these are more typical and expected uses for a blanket. On the other hand, an example of a response that would be considered very original (4) could be using a blanket to create a makeshift hammock indoors, which is a unique and innovative use that most people may not have considered before.",
