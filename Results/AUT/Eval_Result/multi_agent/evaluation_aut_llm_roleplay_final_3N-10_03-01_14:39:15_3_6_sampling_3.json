It demonstrates some creativity in repurposing the item for a different function, which adds novelty to the idea. However, it doesn't reach the level of very original or extremely original as it is still somewhat related to the original purpose of a mug.\n\nFor example, a very common response for the use of a mug could be drinking coffee or tea. A somewhat common response could be using a mug as a pen holder on a desk. In comparison, using a mug as a coaster stack is more creative and less expected, making it a moderately original idea.",
