While using jars for seed storage is not a completely unheard-of idea, it still displays creativity and novelty. The specific use of jars for organizing and preserving seed packets in labeled jars for future generations is not a common or mundane suggestion. It shows a level of creativity beyond typical uses of jars, making it moderately original. \n\nAn example of a very common response would be using jars for storing food items like pickles or jams. This use is quite mundane and commonly associated with jars, lacking novelty or uniqueness. On the other hand, an extremely original response could involve using jars as part of an art installation or as a container for a time capsule buried underground.

This is a very typical and expected use of a blanket, which would fall under \"Very Common\" (1).\n- A slightly more creative use of a blanket would be as a picnic blanket for outdoor gatherings. While not as common as using it for warmth, it is still a relatively common alternative use, falling under \"Somewhat Common\" (2).\n- An even more unique use of a blanket would be to transform it into a makeshift hammock by tying the corners to create a comfortable hanging bed.

While the concept of a heated blanket is not entirely unique, the idea of incorporating heating elements into a blanket for added warmth is innovative and creative. While heated blankets are not uncommon, the specific idea of adding heating elements to a blanket can be considered a moderately creative and novel use of the item. \n\nFor comparison:\n- A common use of a blanket would be to keep warm while sleeping. This is a very typical and expected use of a blanket, which would fall under \"Very Common\" (1).\n- A slightly more creative use of a blanket would be as a picnic blanket for outdoor gatherings. While not as common as using it for warmth, it is still a relatively common alternative use, falling under \"Somewhat Common\" (2).\n- An even more unique use of a blanket would be to transform it into a makeshift hammock by tying the corners to create a comfortable hanging bed. This unexpected and creative use would fall under \"Very Original\" (4).",
