The idea of using a scarf to drape over a mirror as a scarf hanger is creative and unexpected, showing a high level of creativity and ingenuity. This use demonstrates outside-the-box thinking and adds a fashionable and functional element to the typical use of a scarf. It is not a common or mundane idea, making it deserving of a high originality score of 4.",

While using a scarf as a table runner is not a common use, it still retains the basic function of covering a surface. The idea shows creativity in repurposing the item for a different context, but it is not extremely rare or unexpected. \n\nAn example of a very original response could be using a scarf as a makeshift hammock for a small pet, which completely transforms the intended use of the item. On the other hand, a very common response would be using a scarf to keep warm in cold weather, which is the most typical and expected use for a scarf.",
