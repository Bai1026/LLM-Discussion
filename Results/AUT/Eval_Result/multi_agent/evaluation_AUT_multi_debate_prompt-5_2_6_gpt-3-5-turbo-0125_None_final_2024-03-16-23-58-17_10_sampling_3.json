This repurposing of the item showcases outside-the-box thinking and offers a new perspective on how everyday objects can be used in unconventional ways.

While using a mug as a container for DIY air freshener is not a common use, it is not a completely unexpected or rare idea either.

While using a mug for toy storage is not a common or mundane use, it also isn't an extremely rare or unheard-of concept. It shows creativity in repurposing a household item for a different function, which is why it earns a moderately original score.\n\nTo provide some context:\n- A very common use for a mug would be for holding beverages like coffee or tea.\n- An example of a somewhat common use would be using a mug as a pen or pencil holder on a desk.\n- On the other hand, a very original use could be using a mug as a plant pot for small succulents.\n- And an extremely original use might involve transforming the mug into a hanging bird feeder in a garden setting.",
