While it is not a common or mundane use of a mug, it still falls within the realm of kitchen-related uses for the item. It shows some creativity in repurposing the mug in a practical way, but it is not highly unexpected or unique. \n\nFor comparison:\n- A very common use would be drinking beverages from the mug.\n- A somewhat common use could be using the mug as a pencil holder on a desk.\n- A very original use might be using the mug as a mini indoor plant pot.\n- An extremely original use could be turning the mug into a hanging light fixture by adding a bulb and cord.",
