While the idea of using a jar for pet treats is not unheard of, the additional element of DIY decoration to make it stylish and organized adds a creative touch. It shows a fair amount of creativity and novelty by combining functionality with aesthetic appeal. However, it is not a completely rare or unexpected use of a jar. \n\nFor example, a very common response would be using a jar to store pantry items like spices or dry goods, as this is a typical use for a jar. On the other hand, a very original response could be using a jar as a portable herb garden, where the lid has a built-in watering system for growing herbs on a windowsill.
