This idea is not commonly thought of in typical contexts and shows a significant amount of novelty. While using a sheet as fabric for a quilt is somewhat common, the concept of a memory quilt specifically made from fabric scraps is very original. Overall, this response earns a score of 4 for its creativity and unexpectedness.",
