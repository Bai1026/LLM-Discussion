Plus, you can easily wash and reuse the fork, making it a sustainable option for entertaining.\n\nUsing forks to create DIY plant markers in the garden is another practical and creative idea. It's a great way to add some personality to your garden while also keeping track of your plants. You can personalize each fork with different designs or paint colors to make them even more unique.\n\nI'm not sure about using a fork as a tool for scratching hard-to-reach itches on your back.
