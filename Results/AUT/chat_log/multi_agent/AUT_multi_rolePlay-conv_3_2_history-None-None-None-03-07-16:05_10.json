You can fill the jar with baking soda and essential oils to create a natural air freshener, then transfer the mixture into small fabric pouches or tea bags to place in drawers, closets, or shoes for a pleasant scent.\n\nAnother idea inspired by the DIY bird feeder suggestion is to create a mini garden in a jar.

This combines the concept of DIY terrarium with the idea of using the jar as a decorative piece.\n\nTo further enhance the idea of using the jar as a paint palette, you could also use it as a watercolor palette.
