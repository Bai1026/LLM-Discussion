It could provide a fun and immersive experience that adds an element of excitement to the event.\n\nFurthermore, we could consider incorporating a paper costume contest where guests are encouraged to create their own paper-based outfits and accessories. It would be a fun and lighthearted activity that allows guests to showcase their creativity and ingenuity in a playful way.\n\nI think by integrating these ideas, from the paper art installation to the paper maze and costume contest, we can elevate the uniqueness and creativity of our paper-themed party.
