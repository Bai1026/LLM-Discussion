This would add a whimsical touch to any room and could even be a fun DIY project for kids or adults.\n\nRegarding using a mug as a snack holder, I agree that it is a common use and may not be the most creative. Instead, we could explore using a mug as a mini planter for microgreens or sprouts, adding a fresh and nutritious element to our culinary endeavors.\n\nLastly, I believe the idea of using a mug as a candle holder is a fantastic one.
