Those are definitely creative examples!\n\nI'm also thinking of square envelopes, computer keyboards, and gift boxes as other square items. Envelopes are typically square to fit standard paper sizes, keyboards have a square layout of keys, and gift boxes often come in square shapes.\n\nDoes anyone else have more square things to add to our list? Let's keep the creativity flowing!"
