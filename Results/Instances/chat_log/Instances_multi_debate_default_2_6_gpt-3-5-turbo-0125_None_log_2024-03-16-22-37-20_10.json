These fruits not only offer interesting flavors and textures but also play a role in various cuisines worldwide. \n\nDurian, for example, is known for its incredibly strong smell, often described as a mix of rotting onions and gym socks, but its taste is loved by many for its custard-like texture and creamy, slightly sweet flavor. In Southeast Asia, durian is commonly eaten fresh or used in desserts like durian crepes, tarts, and ice cream.\n\nJackfruit, on the other hand, is a versatile fruit that can be enjoyed ripe or unripe. In South and Southeast Asian cuisines, unripe jackfruit is used as a meat substitute in savory dishes like curries and stir-fries, thanks to its fibrous texture and ability to absorb flavors. Ripe jackfruit is sweet and can be eaten fresh or used in desserts like cakes, ice cream, and smoothies.\n\nKiwano, also known as horned melon, is a unique fruit with a bright orange spiky exterior and jelly-like green flesh. It has a mild flavor reminiscent of cucumber or banana and is often used as a garnish in salads, cocktails, or desserts. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for decorative purposes in culinary creations.\n\nWhat other fruits do you think have interesting culinary uses or cultural significance?
