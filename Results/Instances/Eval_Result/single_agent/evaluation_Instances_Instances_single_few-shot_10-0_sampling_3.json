While Gerbera Daisies are a common type of flower, mentioning them in this context does show a fair amount of creativity as it is not the first flower that comes to mind for everyone. It is not as expected or typical as roses or tulips, but it also isn't an extremely unique or rare flower. An example of a very common response would be \"rose\" or \"daisy,\" while an extremely original response might include a more obscure or less commonly known flower like \"Bleeding Heart\" or \"Bird of Paradise.\"",
