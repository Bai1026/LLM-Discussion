While poppies are a well-known type of flower, they are not as commonly mentioned as roses or daisies, for example.

While daisies are a well-known flower, the specific mention of Gerbera Daisies adds a certain uniqueness to the response. It shows some level of originality but does not reach the level of being considered extremely rare or unexpected. \n\nFor comparison, a response that would receive a lower originality score would be listing roses, sunflowers, and tulips. These are flowers that are frequently mentioned and expected in responses to this question. On the other hand, a highly original response would be mentioning lesser-known flowers such as Bird of Paradise, Protea, and Strelitzia, which are not commonly thought of by most people. The inclusion of Gerbera Daisy falls in between these two extremes, hence warranting a score of 3.",
