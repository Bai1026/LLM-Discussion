While the trombone is a widely recognized musical instrument, it is not as common or frequently mentioned as guitars, pianos, or drums. It displays a fair amount of creativity as it is not one of the most expected or typical responses when listing musical instruments. Therefore, I have rated it as a 3. \n\nTo provide some examples:\n- \"Guitar\" or \"Piano\" would likely score lower on the originality scale as they are very common and expected responses.\n- On the other hand, a response like \"Theremin\" or \"Shakuhachi\" would be considered more original and unique, potentially scoring higher on the originality scale.",

The response is moderately original because while pruning shears are a standard tool in gardening, they require specific knowledge and technique to use properly, making them less common than items such as a trowel or watering can. An example of a very common response would be \"shovel,\" as it is one of the most basic tools used in gardening and is frequently mentioned. An example of a very original response could be \"soil pH tester,\" as it is a less commonly thought of tool that is crucial for successful gardening but not as widely recognized as pruning shears.",

A flashback is a literary device in which an earlier event is inserted into the normal chronological order of a narrative. It adds complexity to the storytelling and allows for a deeper exploration of characters and plot. This response stands out as significantly unique and unexpected compared to more common answers like \"characters,\" \"plot,\" or \"setting.\"",

While it may seem straightforward, the concept of a protagonist is a crucial and complex element in storytelling that is not commonly thought of as a tangible item used in literature.

This response stands out as it delves into the abstract and nuanced aspects of literature rather than focusing on physical objects commonly found in stories.",

While portable toilets are indeed a crucial component of festivals, they are a typical and expected feature rather than an exceptionally unique or rare one. Many festivals provide portable toilet facilities for attendees, so the inclusion of this item in a list of things used in festivals is somewhat ordinary.\n\nFor higher originality scores, responses could include more unexpected or less commonly considered items used in festivals. For example, listing unique decorations, specialized lighting equipment, interactive art installations, or specific traditional instruments used during festival performances would be considered more creative and original responses.",
