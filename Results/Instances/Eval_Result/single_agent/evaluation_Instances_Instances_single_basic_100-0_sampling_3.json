While strollers are a common item that moves on wheels, they do show a slight variation from typical uses of wheels, which generally involve vehicles like cars or bikes. Strollers are a specific type of wheeled object used for transporting infants or young children, making them somewhat ordinary but still demonstrating a basic level of creativity in the context of the task. \n\nTo provide some examples:\n- A response like \"cars\" or \"bikes\" would be considered very common as they are the most typical uses of wheels.\n- On the other hand, a response like \"office chairs\" or \"rolling suitcases\" might be rated as moderately original, as they involve wheels but in unique and non-standard ways.",

While watermelon is a well-known fruit and a common response in discussions about fruits, it does show a slight variation from the most typical fruits like apples and oranges.

While the tambourine is a well-known percussion instrument, it is not one of the first instruments that typically come to mind when thinking of musical instruments. It displays creativity as it is not as common as instruments like the piano or guitar. Therefore, it earns a score of 3 for originality. \n\nExamples of responses that would warrant different originality scores:\n- \"Piano\" or \"Guitar\" would likely be considered very common (1) as they are the most typical instruments one would think of.\n- \"Kazoo\" or \"Theremin\" would be classified as very original (4) as they are less commonly known instruments and require more creativity to come up with.",

While barcode scanners and printers are commonly associated with inventory management and retail, they are still specific items that are not typically listed in everyday contexts. However, the use of barcode scanners and printers in the context of \"fulfillment\" could still be considered somewhat ordinary within certain industries.\n\nFor example, a more \"Very Common\" response would be boxes or packaging materials, as these items are typically associated with fulfillment in a more general sense and are commonly mentioned in everyday contexts. On the other hand, a response that would score higher on originality could be something like virtual reality technology for virtual order fulfillment, which would be considered more unique and unexpected in the context of fulfillment processes.",
