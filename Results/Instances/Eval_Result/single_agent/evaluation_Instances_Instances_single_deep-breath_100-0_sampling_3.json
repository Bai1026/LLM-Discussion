However, pans are frequently mentioned in everyday cooking contexts, making them a somewhat ordinary response.\n\nSome examples of responses that would warrant higher originality scores include:\n- 1. Blowtorch: A less conventional cooking tool used for tasks such as caramelizing sugar or searing meats.\n- 2. Mortar and pestle: A kitchen tool used for grinding spices, herbs, or other ingredients.\n- 3.

While mentioning sweetened beverages is a valid answer to the prompt, it is a fairly typical and expected response when thinking of sweet things. It does not show a high level of creativity or uniqueness compared to other more unexpected responses. An example of a more original response would be something like \"Sweet potato pie\" or \"Honey-glazed salmon,\" which introduce a different take on sweet foods beyond the usual desserts.",

Additionally, using a bookshelf as a divider to separate different areas in a bedroom or turning it into a makeshift workspace by adding a desk attachment can also be considered moderately original uses.

Additionally, dusters can come in various forms such as microfiber cloths or feather dusters, adding a level of variation and creativity to the response.\n\nTo provide some context, a response that would score a 1 for very common might be \"mops\" as they are a highly expected and typical item used for cleaning.

While it is a common research method used in sociology, it requires a certain level of creativity and innovation to think of it in the context of items used in sociology.

While pleadings are a common and essential legal document in the legal process, it may not be the first thing that comes to mind when thinking about items used in law for everyone. The term 'pleadings' refers to formal written statements filed by the parties in a legal case that outline their respective claims and defenses. While this may not be an extremely rare or unique response, it still showcases a fair amount of creativity by including a specific legal term rather than more general items like 'courtrooms' or 'briefcases'.",

An example of a response that would score higher in originality could be something like \"sage smudge sticks,\" as they are less common and more specific to certain rituals.",

While it is related to festivals, the idea of vendors selling costumes and clothing is a typical aspect of festivals and is a slightly creative variation on the concept of things used in festivals. It demonstrates a basic level of creativity as it introduces a specific aspect of festival culture, but it is not highly unique or unexpected. Some examples of more original responses could include \"interactive art installations,\" \"food trucks with unique cuisines,\" or \"live performance stages featuring emerging artists,\" which would fall under higher originality scores.",

While merry-go-rounds are commonly associated with amusement parks, they are still a creative and somewhat unexpected response when thinking about things used in amusement.

Bubble wrap is commonly known for its primary use in packaging to protect fragile items during shipping. However, there are several other creative and less common uses for bubble wrap that demonstrate a fair amount of creativity and novelty. \n\n1. Stress relief tool - Popping bubble wrap bubbles can be therapeutic and a stress-relieving activity.\n2. Insulation for plants - Wrapping bubble wrap around plants in cold weather can help insulate them and protect them from frost.\n3. Art and crafts material - Bubble wrap can be used as a textured surface for painting or printing to create unique artwork.\n4. Cushioning for workouts - Bubble wrap can be used as a cushioning material for workouts to provide a soft surface for exercises.\n5.
