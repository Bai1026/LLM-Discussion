While thinking of things that move on wheels, it is not common for individuals to think of wheelchair basketball chairs specifically. This unique combination of a wheelchair and sports equipment shows creativity and innovation in the response. Typically, people might think of common examples like cars, bicycles, skateboards, or shopping carts when prompted with this question. However, the mention of wheelchair basketball chairs deviates from the usual and introduces a new perspective on objects that move on wheels. This level of unexpectedness and creativity warrants a high originality score of 4.",

While it is not a commonly mentioned instrument in everyday contexts, it is known to many and is associated with specific cultures, such as Australian Aboriginal culture. It shows a fair amount of creativity and novelty as it is not a typical instrument that immediately comes to mind for most people when asked to list instruments. Some more common responses, such as guitar or piano, would fall into the somewhat common category, making the inclusion of the Didgeridoo slightly more unique and creative.",
