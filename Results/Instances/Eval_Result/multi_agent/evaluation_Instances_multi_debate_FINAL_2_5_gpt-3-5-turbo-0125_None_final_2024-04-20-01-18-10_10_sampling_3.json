While it is not a common everyday object like a ball or a wheel, it is still a recognizable item that many people have encountered. The mention of a Ferris wheel adds a creative twist to the prompt as it is not the most typical response, yet still falls within the realm of round objects.

While the mention of a drum is not uncommon when listing musical instruments, specifying a Taiko drum adds a level of uniqueness. Taiko drums are traditional Japanese drums known for their large size and powerful sound, making them stand out compared to more common drums like snare drums or tom-toms. This specificity enhances the originality of the response, as it deviates from the expected list of instruments one might typically think of.
