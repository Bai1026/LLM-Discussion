While fire trucks are commonly associated with having wheels for movement, specifying antique fire trucks adds a unique twist to the answer. Antique fire trucks are not as commonly thought of when listing items that move on wheels, making this response moderately original. It goes beyond the typical cars, bicycles, or skateboards that are more commonly mentioned in such scenarios. By mentioning a specific type of vehicle on wheels, the response introduces an element of unexpectedness and creativity.",

While it is not a commonly mentioned instrument in everyday contexts, it is also not highly rare or unexpected. Instruments like the guitar, piano, drums, and flute are more typical responses and would fall under a lower originality score. On the other hand, instruments like the sitar, theremin, kalimba, or didgeridoo would be considered more original and receive a higher score. The inclusion of Baglamas adds a degree of creativity and novelty to the list of instruments, warranting a score of 3.",
