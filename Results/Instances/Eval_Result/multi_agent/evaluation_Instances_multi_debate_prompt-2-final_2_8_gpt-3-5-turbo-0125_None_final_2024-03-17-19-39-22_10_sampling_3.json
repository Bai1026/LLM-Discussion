While it is not a mundane or everyday sound that is typically mentioned when listing things that make noise, it also isn't an extremely rare or unexpected response. It showcases a fair amount of creativity and novelty as it introduces a unique object that can produce a distinct sound. Some more common responses like a doorbell ringing or a car honking would fall into the somewhat common category, while a response like a cat purring might be considered more original. The tape dispenser unwinding adds a creative twist to the list of noise-making items.",
