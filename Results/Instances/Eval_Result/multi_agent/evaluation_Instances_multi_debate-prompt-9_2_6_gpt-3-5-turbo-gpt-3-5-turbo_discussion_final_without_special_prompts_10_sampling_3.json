While culinary sounds like the sizzle of a steak cooking are not commonly listed among typical noise-making items like horns or alarms, they are still somewhat expected within the context of kitchen noises. While it is creative and shows some novelty, it is not highly rare or unexpected. \n\nAn example of a very common response would be listing things like \"car horns\" or \"dog barking,\" as these are very frequently mentioned in everyday contexts and lack novelty. An example of a very original response would be something like \"whispering wind chimes in a bamboo forest,\" as this is unexpected and not commonly considered when thinking of noise-making items.",

Examples of very common responses would include things like a square table, a square window, or a square piece of paper. However, a square pendant necklace adds a slightly more unique touch to the list of square objects, hence the moderate originality score. To achieve a higher originality score, the response would need to include more unexpected or unusual square objects that are rarely thought of in typical contexts.",

While it is not an extremely rare or unheard-of instrument, it is not one of the most common ones either. This shows a good level of creativity in thinking of a less mainstream instrument compared to more typical responses like guitar or piano.\n\nSome examples of responses that would be rated a 1 or 2 for originality would be \"guitar\" or \"drums\", as these are very commonly mentioned instruments in everyday contexts. On the other hand, responses like \"theremin\" or \"hang drum\" would be rated a 5 for originality, as these are extremely unique and not often thought of in typical contexts. \"Doumbek\" falls in between these extremes, displaying a significant level of creativity but not reaching the highest tier of rarity and unexpectedness.",
