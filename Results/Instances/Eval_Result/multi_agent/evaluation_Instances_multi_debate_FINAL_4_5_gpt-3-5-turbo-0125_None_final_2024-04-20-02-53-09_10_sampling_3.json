While crystal balls are commonly associated with fortune-telling and magic, they are not the most typical round object that comes to mind for most people. The association with divination adds a unique twist to the typical round objects that one might list. Overall, it shows a fair amount of creativity and novelty without being extremely rare or unexpected. \n\nFor comparison:\n- If the response was something like \"baseballs\" or \"oranges,\" which are common round objects, it would be considered very common and rated as a 1.\n- If the response was something like \"fidget spinners\" or \"planetary orbits,\" which are less commonly thought of as round objects, it would be considered somewhat common and rated as a 2.\n- If the response was something like \"globe marbles\" or \"hula hoops intertwined,\" which are more creative round objects, it would be considered very original and rated as a 4.",

It shows a fair amount of creativity and novelty by specifically mentioning a unique type of object that moves on wheels, which is not typically the first thing that comes to mind in response to this question. However, it is not highly rare or unexpected, as it still fits within the general category of items that move on wheels. \n\nFor comparison:\n- A response like rollerblades or skateboards would also fall under moderately original as they are not the most common examples but are still within the realm of expected answers. \n- On the other hand, mentioning shopping carts or wheelchairs would be considered somewhat common, as they are more typical responses to this question.",
