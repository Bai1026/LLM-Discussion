While it is not a highly unique or unexpected answer, it does differentiate itself from more common responses like cars, bicycles, or skateboards. Golf carts are not always the first thing that comes to mind when thinking about things that move on wheels, hence earning a score of 3. An even more original response might include items like rollerblades, wheelchairs, or supermarket shopping carts.",

While horse-drawn carriages are not as common today as they once were, they still fall within the realm of traditional transportation methods using animals or wheeled vehicles. However, it shows a fair amount of creativity compared to more typical responses like cars, bikes, or skateboards. \n\nFor example, a response like \"hoverboards\" would be considered very original (4 points) as they are a futuristic mode of transportation that many people may not immediately think of when considering things that move on wheels. \"Unicycles\" could also be considered somewhat original (2 points) as they are less common than bicycles but still fall within the scope of wheeled transportation devices.",
