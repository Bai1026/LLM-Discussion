            "pH Testing: Use a pH testing kit to determine the acidity or alkalinity of the soil samples. Most plants prefer a slightly acidic to neutral pH level for optimal growth. The group can compare the pH levels of the two soil samples to see which one falls within the ideal range.",
            "Water Retention Test: To test the water retention capabilities of the soil samples, fill two separate containers with each type of soil and water them the same amount. Monitor how quickly the water is absorbed and how long it takes for the soil to dry out. This will give an indication of which soil holds moisture better for plant growth.",
            "Nutrient Analysis: Conduct a nutrient analysis of the soil samples to determine the levels of essential nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. These nutrients are crucial for plant growth, so comparing the nutrient composition of the two soil samples can help determine which one is more suitable for planting.",
