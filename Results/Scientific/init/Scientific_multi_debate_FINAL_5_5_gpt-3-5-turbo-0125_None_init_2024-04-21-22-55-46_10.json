            "Person A: One way we can test which light bulb is more energy-efficient is by using a watt meter. We can simply screw each light bulb into a lamp socket and then use the watt meter to measure the power consumption of each bulb over a certain period of time. The bulb that consumes less power would be the more energy-efficient one.",
            "Person B: Another way we can test the energy efficiency of the light bulbs is by calculating their luminous efficacy. This can be done by dividing the amount of light output (in lumens) by the power input (in watts) of each bulb. The bulb with the higher luminous efficacy would be the more energy-efficient one.",
            "Person C: We can also consider the color temperature of the light bulbs. Light bulbs with higher color temperatures tend to be more energy-efficient as they produce more light per watt. So, we can compare the color temperatures of both bulbs and choose the one with the higher temperature as the more energy-efficient option.",
            "Person D: Additionally, we can look at the lifespan of the light bulbs. Energy-efficient bulbs tend to have longer lifespans, meaning they will need to be replaced less frequently, saving both energy and money in the long run. We can compare the estimated lifespan of each bulb and choose the one with the longer lifespan as the more energy-efficient option.",
            "Person E: Another factor to consider is the energy efficiency rating of the light bulbs. Many modern light bulbs come with an energy efficiency label, such as Energy Star, which indicates how efficient the bulb is at converting electricity into light. We can compare the energy efficiency ratings of both bulbs and choose the one with the higher rating as the more energy-efficient option."
