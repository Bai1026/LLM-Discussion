This instrument measures the absorption of light at various wavelengths, allowing us to compare the UV absorbance of two different sunscreens. The procedure would involve preparing samples of each sunscreen, measuring their absorbance at specific UV wavelengths, and calculating the percentage of UV radiation blocked by each sunscreen.",

This test would involve placing a sample of each sunscreen between a UV light source and a UV detector to measure the amount of UV radiation that passes through the sunscreen. A lower transmittance percentage would indicate a higher level of UV protection.",
