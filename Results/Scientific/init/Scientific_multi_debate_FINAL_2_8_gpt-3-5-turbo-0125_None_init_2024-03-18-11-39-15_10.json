        "answer": [
            "Elasticity Testing: As mentioned, using a rubber band to measure elasticity in a physics experiment could be a valuable tool. By stretching the rubber band to various lengths and recording the force required to stretch it, students can learn about the concept of elastic potential energy.",
            "Spectrophotometry: Attach a rubber band around a cuvette containing a solution to hold it securely in place during spectrophotometry experiments. This can prevent any unwanted movement of the cuvette and ensure accurate readings.",
            "Microscopy: Wrap a rubber band around the focus knob of a microscope to help stabilize the focus point. This can be especially helpful in educational settings where students may struggle with keeping the microscope in focus.",
            "Chromatography: Use a rubber band to secure chromatography paper to a jar or test tube during experiments. This can help prevent the paper from moving and ensure accurate results.",
            "Pipetting: Attach a rubber band around a pipette bulb to improve grip and control while transferring liquids. This can be especially useful when working with small volumes or in precise measurements.",
            "Seed Germination: Use a rubber band to secure a plastic bag containing seeds and a wet paper towel for germination experiments. This can create a makeshift greenhouse environment to observe the germination process.",
            "Electrophoresis: Secure gel plates in an electrophoresis apparatus using rubber bands to ensure proper alignment and prevent leakage during experiments. This can help maintain consistent results and prevent errors.",
            "Thermodynamics: Use a rubber band to create a simple heat engine demonstration. By attaching one end of the rubber band to a fixed point and the other end to a spinning wheel, students can observe the conversion of elastic potential energy into kinetic energy."
