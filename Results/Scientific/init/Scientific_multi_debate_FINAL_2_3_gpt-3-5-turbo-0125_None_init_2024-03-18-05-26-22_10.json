            "One innovative use for a rubber band in science could be creating a simple seismograph. By attaching a pen to a rubber band and placing it on a stable surface, any vibrations or movements in the ground could be recorded by the pen moving on a piece of paper underneath.",
            "Another idea could be using a rubber band as a makeshift spectrophotometer. By stretching the rubber band to different lengths and shining a light through it, you could measure the absorption or transmission of light at different wavelengths, giving insight into the material properties of the rubber band.",
            "We could also use a rubber band as a simple tool to demonstrate the concept of potential energy. By wrapping the rubber band around a small object and stretching it, we can store potential energy in the rubber band, which is then released when the rubber band is allowed to snap back into its original shape.",
            "One more idea could be using a rubber band as a DIY electrophoresis gel comb. By cutting notches into a rubber band at regular intervals, it could be used to create wells in a gel for separating DNA or proteins based on size.",
            "Lastly, we could explore using a rubber band as a model for studying wave mechanics. By attaching one end of a rubber band to a fixed point and oscillating the other end, we could observe how waves travel through the rubber band and study properties such as frequency and wavelength."
