While conducting in vivo testing on humans is a common method for determining the efficacy of products, it still requires a fair amount of creativity and novelty in the context of comparing two sunscreens for UV protection. This method involves testing the sunscreens on human subjects to observe their effectiveness in protecting against UV rays. It is not the most typical or expected response, as some may have suggested lab tests or standard measurements. However, it is not extremely unique or rare, as in vivo testing is a known practice in dermatology and skincare research.",
