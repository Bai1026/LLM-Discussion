Apply a standardized amount of each sunscreen to separate UV transparent plates.\n4. Place the plates in the UV spectrophotometer to measure the UV transmission.\n5. Compare the percentage of UV radiation blocked by each sunscreen sample.\n6. The sunscreen that blocks a higher percentage of UV radiation provides better protection.\n\nOverall, the response provides a clear and structured outline of the methods, necessary instruments, and a brief procedure for determining which sunscreen provides better UV protection. The steps are well-defined and logically sequenced, making it easy to understand the testing process. Additionally, the response includes specific details such as using a UV spectrophotometer and comparing the percentage of UV radiation blocked, which add depth to the explanation. Therefore, I would rate this response as [[4]] for its highly elaborated content.",
