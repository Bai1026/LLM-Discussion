The idea of measuring heat output as an indicator of energy efficiency is somewhat common in the context of comparing different appliances or devices.\n\nA more original approach could involve using a wattmeter to measure the power consumption of each light bulb directly. By comparing the power usage of both bulbs while producing the same amount of light output, one can determine which bulb is more energy-efficient. This method directly relates power consumption to energy efficiency and is a more conventional approach in testing the efficiency of light bulbs. \n\nIn conclusion, while using a thermal imaging camera is a moderately original idea, there are more direct and standard methods available that could be considered slightly more innovative.",
