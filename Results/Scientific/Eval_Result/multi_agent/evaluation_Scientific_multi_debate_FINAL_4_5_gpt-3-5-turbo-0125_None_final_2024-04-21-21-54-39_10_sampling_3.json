While using a UV spectrophotometer to measure UV protection is a common method in scientific research and product development, it still requires specific knowledge and equipment that not everyone may be familiar with. This method involves analyzing the absorption of UV light by the sunscreen samples, which can give a quantitative measure of their UV protection abilities.\n\nAn example of a very common response would be simply comparing the SPF ratings of the sunscreens, which is a widely known method but lacks creativity or novelty. On the other hand, a very original response might suggest using advanced nanotechnology to assess the effectiveness of UV filters in the sunscreens, which is a highly unique and cutting-edge approach.",
