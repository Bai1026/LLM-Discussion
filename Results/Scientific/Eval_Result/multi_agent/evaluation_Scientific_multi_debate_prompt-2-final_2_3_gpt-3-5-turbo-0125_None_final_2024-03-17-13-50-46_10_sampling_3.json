While the idea of adding an emergency alert feature is somewhat unique and could be considered practical and innovative, it is not a completely new concept. Many smartwatches already have similar features such as SOS alerts and emergency contact settings. \n\nTo provide some examples for different originality levels:\n- A response suggesting adding a biometric sensor to monitor the wearer's vital signs and alerting emergency services in case of a medical emergency would be rated as a 4 out of 5 for its unique approach to combining health monitoring with emergency alerts.\n- On the other hand, a response suggesting adding a basic stopwatch function to a wristwatch would be rated as a 1 out of 5 for its lack of novelty and commonality in standard wristwatches.\n\nTherefore, the response suggesting an emergency alert feature, while somewhat unique, falls in the moderately original category.[[3]]",
