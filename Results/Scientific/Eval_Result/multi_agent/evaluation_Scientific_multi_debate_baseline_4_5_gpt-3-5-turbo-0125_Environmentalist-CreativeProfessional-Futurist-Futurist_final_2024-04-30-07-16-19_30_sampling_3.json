This concept has been implemented in various design projects and eco-friendly initiatives before. However, it does display a fair amount of creativity by combining the elements of elegance, sustainability, and responsible material sourcing to enhance the mirror's aesthetics.\n\nFor comparison:\n- A response that would be rated as a 2 might suggest adding LED lights around the mirror for better visibility, which, while a slight variation from the norm, is still a somewhat common upgrade idea.\n- On the other hand, a response that would receive a 4 might propose incorporating a hidden camera behind the mirror for security purposes, providing a significantly unique and unexpected feature to elevate its functionality and sophistication.\n\nOverall, the integration of sustainable materials adds a creative touch to the traditional mirror upgrade, but it falls slightly short of being highly original or unexpected, hence the rating of 3.",
