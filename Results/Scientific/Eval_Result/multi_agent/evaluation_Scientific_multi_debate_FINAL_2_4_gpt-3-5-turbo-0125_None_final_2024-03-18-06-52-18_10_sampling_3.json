While this method involves collaboration with skincare experts and analyzing the penetration and protective barrier formation of each sunscreen, it is not a common method discussed in everyday contexts. The idea of measuring the depth and durability of UV protection is less conventional and showcases a fair amount of creativity.\n\nFor comparison:\n- A very common response would be to compare the SPF (Sun Protection Factor) ratings of each sunscreen, which is a widely known and typical method.\n- A somewhat common response might suggest conducting a UV absorption test to measure how well each sunscreen absorbs UV rays, showing a slight variation from the usual method.\n- A very original response could involve using a UV camera to visually observe how well each sunscreen blocks UV rays on the skin, offering a significantly unique approach.",

However, this approach is somewhat commonly used in consumer product testing and market research, so it doesn't fall into the category of being extremely unique or rare.\n\nTo provide examples for different ratings:\n- If a response had suggested using a specialized UV camera to measure the exact amount of UV rays blocked by each sunscreen, this would be a very original idea deserving of a 4.\n- On the other hand, if a response had simply mentioned conducting a comparison test on volunteers without any unique or creative methods, it would be considered a 2.",
