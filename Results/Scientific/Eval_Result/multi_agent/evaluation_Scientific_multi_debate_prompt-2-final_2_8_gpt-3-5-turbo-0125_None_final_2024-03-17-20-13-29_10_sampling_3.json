While these tests may not be entirely uncommon in the field of skincare research, the combination of both tests for comparing sunscreen efficacy adds a level of creativity and novelty to the approach. \n\nA more common response would be to simply measure the SPF (Sun Protection Factor) of each sunscreen, which is a standard method for evaluating UV protection but lacks the depth provided by the skin barrier and hydration tests. On the other hand, an extremely original response might involve incorporating advanced biophysical techniques or wearable sensors to directly measure UV exposure and its effects on the skin in real-time, which would be a highly unique and rare approach.\n\nOverall, the integration of skin barrier and hydration tests for assessing sunscreen efficacy warrants a score of 3 for its moderately original and creative take on evaluating UV protection.",
