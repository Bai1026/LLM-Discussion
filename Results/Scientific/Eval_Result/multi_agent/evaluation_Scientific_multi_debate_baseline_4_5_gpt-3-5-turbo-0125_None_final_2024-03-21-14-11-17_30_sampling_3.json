By highlighting how sectors like shipping, logistics, and tourism would be transformed, the response adds a level of depth and specificity that sets it apart from more general or predictable responses. This perspective demonstrates a fair amount of creativity and originality, warranting a score of 3. \n\nIn comparison, a response that simply mentions the convenience of teleportation for personal travel or the reduction of carbon emissions from traditional transportation methods would be considered more common and score lower on the originality scale. On the other hand, a highly original response might delve into the societal impacts on culture, relationships, or even potential ethical dilemmas arising from instant teleportation.",

However, this method is still relatively basic and lacks significant originality compared to more unique and innovative testing methods that could be proposed. \n\nTo provide an example of a response that could receive a higher originality score, a very original approach could involve using specialized equipment like a calorimeter to measure the heat released during combustion of the blankets, or conducting a series of controlled burn tests in a controlled environment with varying conditions to determine the fire resistance more precisely.

By including these specific criteria, the response goes beyond a general comparison and delves deeper into the technical aspects of fire-resistance testing. \n\nAn example of a 'Very Common' response might simply state to test both blankets by exposing them to a direct flame and observing which one catches fire first. An example of a 'Somewhat Common' response could involve suggesting to use a stopwatch to time how long it takes for each blanket to ignite. On the other hand, a 'Very Original' response might propose using a specialized fire chamber to simulate different fire scenarios and a high-speed camera to capture and analyze the behavior of each blanket during exposure.\n\nOverall, the inclusion of specific parameters for comparison elevates the originality of the response from being merely standard to moderately creative and thoughtful.",
