Energy-efficient bulbs typically have focused spectrums with less wasted energy. By comparing the spectral characteristics, we can determine which bulb is more energy-efficient based on the emitted light spectrum.\nLight Pollution Meter Test: Incorporate a light pollution meter into the testing procedure to measure the light pollution levels around each bulb. Energy-efficient bulbs aim to minimize light pollution by directing light output where needed. Comparing light pollution levels can indicate which bulb is better at minimizing wasted light.\nDimmer Switch and Energy Consumption Assessment: Introduce a dimmer switch to adjust the brightness levels of each bulb and monitor power consumption at different light levels. A bulb that maintains energy efficiency at varying brightness settings may be considered more energy-efficient overall.\nUser Feedback Survey: Conduct a user feedback survey to gather opinions on perceived brightness, color quality, and overall satisfaction with each bulb. Combining objective measurements with subjective feedback can provide a comprehensive understanding of energy efficiency based on user preferences.\nEndurance Challenge - Longevity Test: Set up a light bulb endurance challenge by running both bulbs continuously for a set period (e.g., 24 hours) and monitor their performance. The bulb that maintains consistent light output with minimal degradation could be considered more energy-efficient in terms of reliability and longevity.\nEnvironmental Sustainability Assessment: Evaluate the recyclability of each light bulb's components to assess their impact on the environment. Energy-efficient bulbs often use recyclable materials and have lower environmental footprints. Examining recyclability can add another dimension to understanding energy efficiency in terms of sustainability.\nHeat Dissipation Study: Utilize a thermal imaging camera to observe how heat is distributed around each bulb during operation. A bulb that efficiently dissipates heat and maintains a lower operating temperature may be more energy-efficient in terms of thermal performance.",
