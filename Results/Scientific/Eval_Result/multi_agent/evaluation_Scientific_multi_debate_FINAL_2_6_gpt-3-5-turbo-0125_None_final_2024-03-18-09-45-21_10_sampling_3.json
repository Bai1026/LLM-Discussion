However, it lacks specificity on the actual scientific testing methods, necessary instruments, and a detailed procedure for the test. It briefly mentions capturing user perceptions and satisfaction levels, but does not elaborate on how this method can definitively determine which sunscreen provides better UV protection. Additional detail and explanation would have enhanced the elaboration of the response.",
