This adds a small level of creativity to the standard process of testing sunscreens. However, this method is still somewhat expected and commonly used in the evaluation of sun protection products.\n\nAn example of a response that would receive a higher originality score would be if the participant suggested using a spectrophotometer to measure the amount of UV radiation the sunscreens filter out, providing a more scientific and precise method compared to the standard SPF test. This would demonstrate a higher level of creativity and innovation in determining the better UV protection of the two sunscreens. \n\nOverall, while the idea presented in the response is slightly different from the typical SPF test, it still falls within the realm of common methods used for sunscreen testing, hence the rating of 2.[[2]]",
