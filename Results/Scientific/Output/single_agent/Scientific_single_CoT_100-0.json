            "Testing methods: The most common method for testing tire traction is the coefficient of friction test. This involves measuring the amount of force required to make the tires slip on a surface.",

            "Basic steps:",
            "Analyze the results: Based on the collected data, you can determine which tire has better traction under the specific tested conditions. Keep in mind that the results might vary in real-world driving scenarios due to variables like speed, temperature, and road conditions.",
            "Optional advanced testing: You can also conduct braking distance tests using the two types of tires to see if there is a difference in stopping distance on different road surfaces. This may provide additional insights into traction performance."
