            "If humans were able to hear ultrasonic frequencies, our perception of sound and communication would undergo a significant transformation. We would suddenly have the ability to perceive sounds that are currently beyond our range of hearing, granting us access to a wider spectrum of auditory information. This newfound sensitivity to ultrasonic frequencies would likely enhance our communication skills, as we would be able to discern subtle cues and signals that were previously undetectable. For instance, we might be able to pick up on changes in pitch or frequency in someone's voice, providing us with deeper insight into their emotions or intentions. However, this heightened sensitivity to ultrasonic frequencies could also prove to be overwhelming and disorienting. Our ears would be inundated with a constant stream of new sounds, potentially resulting in sensory overload and making it challenging to distinguish relevant information from background noise. Overall, the ability to hear ultrasonic frequencies would revolutionize our understanding of sound and communication, paving the way for novel opportunities to engage with the world in previously unexplored ways.

Simultaneously perform designated tasks on both smartphones, such as video streaming, web browsing, gaming, and calls. Use a timer to monitor the test duration, and rotate through different activities to simulate varied usage scenarios. Monitor and record the battery percentage at regular intervals, such as every 30 minutes, to track the battery drain rate. Continue the tasks until one smartphone reaches a predefined threshold or shuts down. Record the total time each smartphone lasted and analyze the data to compare the battery life based on tasks performed and overall battery drain rate."
