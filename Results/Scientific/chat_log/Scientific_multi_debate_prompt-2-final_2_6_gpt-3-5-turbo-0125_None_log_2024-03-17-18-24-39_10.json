We can then examine the surface to see if there is any sign of sunburn or UV damage to determine which sunscreen provides better protection.\n\nIdea 6: To test the effectiveness of each sunscreen in real-life conditions, we can conduct a field test where we apply each sunscreen to different parts of the body and then expose ourselves to the sun for a set period. We can then compare the level of protection provided by each sunscreen.\n\nOverall, we can combine a variety of methods including SPF testing, UV radiation measurement, absorption spectrum analysis, water resistance testing, wear testing, and field testing to determine which of the two sunscreens provides better UV protection. By using a combination of these methods, we can get a comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness of each sunscreen and make an informed decision on which one to use for sun protection.
