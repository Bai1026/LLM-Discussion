The light bulb with the lower power consumption is considered more energy-efficient. \n\nAdditionally, you could also consider the lumens output of each light bulb. Lumens measure the brightness of the light source. If one light bulb produces the same amount of light with lower power consumption, it would be considered more energy-efficient.\n\nAnother consideration is the color temperature of the light bulbs. LED light bulbs, for example, are known to be more energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan compared to incandescent bulbs.
