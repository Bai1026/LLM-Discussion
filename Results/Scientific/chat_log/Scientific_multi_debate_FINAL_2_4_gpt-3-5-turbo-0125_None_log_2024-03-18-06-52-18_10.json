We can plug each light bulb into the watt meter and measure the amount of power each bulb consumes over a certain period of time. The lower the wattage, the more energy-efficient the light bulb is.\n\nTeammate 2: Another way we could test the energy efficiency is by using a lux meter to measure the brightness of each light bulb. A more energy-efficient light bulb should produce the same amount of light with less power consumption.\n\nTeammate 3: We could also consider the color temperature of the light bulbs. LED bulbs, for example, are typically more energy-efficient because they produce light in a more focused spectrum, whereas incandescent bulbs produce light in a broader spectrum, wasting energy.\n\nTeammate 4: How about conducting a visual inspection of the bulbs? Energy-efficient bulbs are usually labeled with an energy star rating or an energy efficiency label. These labels provide information on the bulbs' energy consumption and efficiency, making it easier for us to compare the two options.\n\nTeammate 5: We could also consider the lifespan of the light bulbs. Generally, more energy-efficient bulbs tend to have a longer lifespan, which means they will need to be replaced less frequently, thus saving energy in the long run.\n\nTeammate 6: To conduct a simple testing procedure, we could place both light bulbs in identical fixtures and turn them on for a specific amount of time. We could then compare the electricity usage of each bulb based on their wattage and brightness. This would give us a good indication of which one is more energy-efficient."

We can apply both sunscreens to different sections of a UV-sensitive paper and then expose it to sunlight for a set amount of time. By measuring the UV intensity absorbed by each section, we can determine which sunscreen offers better protection.\n\nTeammate 2: Another method we could use is the SPF (Sun Protection Factor) test. We could apply both sunscreens to the same test subjects at the same time and expose them to UV light. After a certain period, we can measure the level of erythema (skin redness) caused by the exposure to determine which sunscreen provides better protection.\n\nTeammate 3: I also think it would be important to consider the ingredients in each sunscreen. Some ingredients, like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, are known for their high UV protection properties. We could analyze the composition of each sunscreen and compare the effectiveness of these ingredients in providing protection against UVA and UVB rays.\n\nTeammate 4: Additionally, we could conduct a water resistance test to see how well each sunscreen holds up under different conditions.
