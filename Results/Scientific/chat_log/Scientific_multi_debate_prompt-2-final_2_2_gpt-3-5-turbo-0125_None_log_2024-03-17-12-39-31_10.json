No more having to go to the optometrist every time your vision changes - the glasses could just adjust themselves.\n\nI love that idea! And what if the frames were also customizable? Maybe they could change colors or patterns with just a touch of a button, so you could match them to your outfit or mood.\n\nThat would be so cool! And speaking of customization, what about adding interchangeable lenses so you could easily switch between different tints or styles depending on the day?\n\nI like that idea!
