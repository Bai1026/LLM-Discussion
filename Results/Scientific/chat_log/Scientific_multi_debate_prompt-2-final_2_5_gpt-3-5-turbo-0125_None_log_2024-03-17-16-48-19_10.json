One idea could be to use a UV spectrophotometer to measure the absorption of UV radiation by each sunscreen. This would give us a quantitative measure of the amount of UV rays that each sunscreen is blocking.\n\n2. Another method could be to conduct a sun protection factor (SPF) test on both sunscreens. This would involve applying a specific amount of each sunscreen to a test strip, exposing it to UV light, and then measuring the level of redness or irritation on the skin to determine the SPF value.\n\n3.

In terms of necessary instruments, we would need a UV spectrophotometer, sunscreen test strips, a UV light source, a UV camera, and a method for measuring SPF values.\n\n5. For the procedure, we could start by calibrating the UV spectrophotometer and applying a controlled amount of each sunscreen to separate test strips. We would then expose the test strips to UV light and measure the absorption levels for each sunscreen. \n\n6. Simultaneously, we could conduct the SPF test on a group of volunteers by applying each sunscreen to their skin and exposing it to UV light.
