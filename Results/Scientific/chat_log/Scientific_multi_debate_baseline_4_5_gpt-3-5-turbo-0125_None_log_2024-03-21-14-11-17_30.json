The necessary tools for this test include the blankets to be tested, a flame source (such as a lighter or matches), a non-flammable surface, a timer, and a fire extinguisher for safety.\n\nProcedure for conducting a burn test to determine the fire-resistance of blankets:\n\n1. Set up a safe testing area free of flammable materials.\n2. Lay out one sample of each type of blanket flat on a non-flammable surface.\n3. Use a lighter or match to ignite a corner of one blanket sample.\n4. Start the timer and observe how the blanket reacts to the fire - note flame spread, smoke production, self-extinguishing properties, and overall burn time.\n5. Repeat the same process with the other blanket sample and record observations.\n6. Compare the results from both tests to determine which blanket is more fire-resistant based on factors such as ignition time, flame spread rate, and self-extinguishing properties.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that a burn test is a qualitative comparison and should not be the sole determinant of fire resistance. For more accurate and detailed testing, it is recommended to consult with fire safety professionals or testing laboratories specializing in fire resistance testing. Safety precautions should always be followed when conducting any type of flammability test."
