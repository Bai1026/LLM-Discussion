Pollutant Exposure Test: Apply sunscreens to skin models and expose them to UV light in the presence of pollutants. Evaluate skin damage levels post-exposure to determine which sunscreen offers better protection in polluted environments.\n\n8. Time-Lapse Photography Test: Apply sunscreens to clear films and photograph them before and after UV exposure over a set period. Analyze changes in the films to visually compare protective abilities over time for long-term performance assessment.\n\n9. Skin Microbiome Analysis: Apply sunscreens to skin samples and analyze changes in the skin's microbiome after UV exposure. Understand the impact of each sunscreen on the skin's natural defense mechanisms for overall skin health insights."
