One idea could be to use a UV-sensitive camera to capture the amount of UV radiation blocked by each sunscreen. Another idea could be to create a DIY UV radiation sensor using a UV-sensitive dye that changes color when exposed to UV rays. \n\nFor the test, we could set up a controlled environment with a UV light source, two samples of each sunscreen, and the UV-sensitive camera or DIY sensor. We would first measure the baseline UV radiation without any sunscreen, then apply each sunscreen to separate test areas and measure the amount of UV radiation blocked by each.\n\nWe could also consider testing the effectiveness of the sunscreens on different types of skin, as skin pigmentation can affect how well a sunscreen works. This could involve using different skin models or even live volunteers with varying skin tones.\n\nAdditionally, we could explore unconventional methods like using artificial sunlight or simulating different weather conditions to see how the sunscreens perform in real-world scenarios.\n\nWhat are some other innovative ideas or approaches we could consider for testing the UV protection of sunscreens?
