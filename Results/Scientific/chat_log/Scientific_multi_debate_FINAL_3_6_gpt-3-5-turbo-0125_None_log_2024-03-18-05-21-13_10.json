This instrument can measure the cumulative UV exposure over a set period for each sunscreen, providing quantitative data on their protective abilities. By comparing the total UV radiation absorbed by the dosimeter, we can determine which sunscreen offers better protection against UV rays.\n\nTeammate 5 from another team: Adding to that, we could also conduct a skin hydration test to assess the impact of each sunscreen on skin hydration levels. UV exposure can lead to skin dehydration, so measuring the skin's hydration level after using each sunscreen can give us valuable insight into their overall effectiveness in protecting against UV damage and maintaining skin health.\n\nTeammate 1 from my team: Lastly, to get a more hands-on perspective, we could involve a UV protection challenge where we apply each sunscreen to different objects or materials and expose them to UV light. This interactive and engaging test can provide a practical demonstration of how well each sunscreen protects against UV damage in various settings.\n\nBy combining these methods, including a water resistance test, UV fluorescence testing, UV dosimeter measurements, skin hydration tests, and a UV protection challenge, we can conduct a diverse and comprehensive evaluation to determine which of the two sunscreens provides better UV protection.

By measuring how much UV radiation is blocked by each sunscreen using the UV Index Meter, we can obtain quantitative data on their protective capabilities. This method would give us a precise measurement of UV protection.\n\nTeammate 4: Adding a visual element to our assessment, we could conduct a UV light shadow test. Using a UV lamp, we can project shadows of different objects or patterns onto the skin with each sunscreen applied. The sunscreen that allows the least amount of UV exposure in the shadows would indicate better overall protection.\n\nTeammate 5: Lastly, we could consider a UV exposure resilience test. Volunteers could wear each sunscreen during a versatile outdoor activity day. By assessing the level of UV exposure and any skin damage post-activity, we can gauge which sunscreen provided better protection during prolonged exposure to the sun.\n\nTeammate 1: By incorporating these diverse methods, including UV color-changing tests, UV protection obstacle course challenges, UV Index Meter testing, UV light shadow tests, and UV exposure resilience assessments, we can conduct a unique and holistic evaluation to determine which sunscreen offers better UV protection.
