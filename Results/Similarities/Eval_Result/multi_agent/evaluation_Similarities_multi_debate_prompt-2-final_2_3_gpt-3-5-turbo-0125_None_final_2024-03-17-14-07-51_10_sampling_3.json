While mentioning that both cakes and pies can have a crumb topping is somewhat unique and not always the first thing that comes to mind when comparing the two desserts, it is still a somewhat common and expected similarity. This response shows a fair amount of creativity by highlighting a specific aspect of both cakes and pies, but it is not highly rare or unexpected. An example of a response that would be rated higher on the originality scale would be if someone mentioned that both cakes and pies can be served warm or cold, as this aspect goes beyond the typical ingredients or toppings comparison.",
