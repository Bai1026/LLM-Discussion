It provides a unique perspective on the similarities between the two entities, as most people would typically focus on their ability to fly or aerodynamics. \n\nOn the other hand, examples of responses that would score higher on the originality scale could include: \n1. They both have wings for flight, but birds use natural wings while airplanes have mechanical wings. This perspective highlights the similarity in their flight capabilities but also emphasizes the difference in how those abilities are achieved. \n2. They both have specific habitats - birds live in nests or trees, while airplanes are housed in airports or hangars. This comparison highlights the different environments in which birds and airplanes exist, showing a more nuanced understanding of their similarities beyond just their navigation systems. \n\nOverall, while the original response is creative and offers a unique perspective, it falls within the moderately original category and would benefit from a more unexpected or rare comparison to achieve a higher rating.
