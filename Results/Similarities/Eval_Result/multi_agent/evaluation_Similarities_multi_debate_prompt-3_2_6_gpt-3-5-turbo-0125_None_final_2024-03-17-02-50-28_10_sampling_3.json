While the comparison of fish and whales in terms of their cultural symbolism is not necessarily a common way to approach the topic, it does show creativity and a unique perspective. Typically, when asked to compare fish and whales, people tend to focus on their physical characteristics, habitats, behaviors, etc. However, this response takes a more abstract and literary approach by exploring how both animals are used as symbols in myths and literature.\n\nTo provide an example of responses at various originality levels:\n- A very common response would be listing their physical differences and similarities, such as mentioning that both fish and whales are aquatic animals.\n- A somewhat common response would be discussing their ecological roles, like how both fish and whales play important roles in their respective ecosystems.\n- A highly original response would involve comparing fish and whales in a unique way, such as exploring their cultural significance or their representation in art and folklore.\n\nOverall, the response falls into the moderately original category as it offers a creative and interesting perspective, although it could be further enhanced by including additional unique points beyond cultural symbolism.[[3]]",
