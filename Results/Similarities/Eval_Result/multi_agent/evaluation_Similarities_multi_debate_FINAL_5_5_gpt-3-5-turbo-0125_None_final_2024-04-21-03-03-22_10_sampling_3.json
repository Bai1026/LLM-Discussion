While it is not a commonly discussed aspect when comparing cakes and pies, the connection between these sweet treats and the emotions they evoke is a creative take on the question.\n\nFor comparison:\n- A response that simply listed physical similarities such as \"both are baked desserts\" would be considered very common and receive a score of 1.\n- A response that mentioned similarities in ingredients but didn't go beyond that would be somewhat common and receive a score of 2.\n- A response that highlighted unique flavor combinations that can be found in both cakes and pies, demonstrating a more creative angle, would be considered very original and receive a score of 4.\n- A response that explored the cultural significance and symbolism of cakes and pies in different societies, connecting them to broader themes, would be extremely original and receive a score of 5.",
