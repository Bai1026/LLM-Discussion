However, it does not reach the level of being significantly unique or unexpected, hence the score of 3. \n\nFor comparison:\n- A response focusing on how both parks and gardens provide a space for relaxation and leisure activities would be considered very common and receive a score of 1.\n- A response mentioning that both parks and gardens feature a variety of plant life would be somewhat common and earn a score of 2.\n- A response highlighting how both parks and gardens serve as venues for social gatherings and events could be seen as fairly original and merit a score of 3 as well.",
