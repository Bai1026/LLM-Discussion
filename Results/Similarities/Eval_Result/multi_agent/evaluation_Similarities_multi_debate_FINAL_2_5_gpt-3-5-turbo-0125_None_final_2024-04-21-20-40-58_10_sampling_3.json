While the idea of pencils and pens being tools for creativity and expression is not entirely uncommon, the way it is presented in the response goes beyond the physical attributes of the objects. By highlighting the symbolic connection between pencils and pens to art and storytelling, the response adds a creative and unique perspective to the comparison. However, this concept is not highly rare or unexpected, hence the moderate originality score. \n\nTo provide an example at a higher level of originality, a response that could receive a 4 or 5 rating might delve into the nuanced differences in the history and cultural significance of pencils and pens, or explore a metaphorical comparison between the two objects in a way that is completely unexpected and highly creative.",

Instead, it delves into the emotional and philosophical aspects of how stars and planets are alike. The idea that both inspire curiosity, wonder, and awe in people and spark imagination and exploration is unique and not commonly considered when comparing celestial bodies. While most people may think about the scientific aspects of stars and planets, this response takes it a step further by highlighting the emotional and inspirational impact they have on individuals. This added depth and perspective make the response very original.",
