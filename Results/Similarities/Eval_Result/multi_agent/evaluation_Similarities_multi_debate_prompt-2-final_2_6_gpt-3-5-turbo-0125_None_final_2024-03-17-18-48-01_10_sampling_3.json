While the idea of both birds and airplanes having a sense of direction is somewhat unique and not immediately obvious to everyone, it is not an entirely original or groundbreaking comparison. The concept of navigation or migration is a common thread between the two, as they both rely on some form of orientation to reach their destinations.\n\nFor example, a more common and expected response would be that both birds and airplanes can fly. This is a simplistic comparison that lacks the level of creativity and depth shown in the sense of direction or orientation for migration or navigation. On the other hand, a very original response could be comparing the aerodynamics of bird flight to plane design, highlighting the unique ways in which both utilize air currents to stay aloft.\n\nOverall, while the response is moderately original in linking birds and airplanes through the concept of orientation for movement, it falls short of being highly original due to the somewhat expected nature of the comparison.",
