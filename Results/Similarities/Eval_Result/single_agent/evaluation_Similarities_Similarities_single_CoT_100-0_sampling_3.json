However, this idea is not highly rare or unexpected, as it is a relatively common association with both diaries and journals. \n\nTo provide an example for each level of originality:\n- If the response had only stated that both diaries and journals are used for writing personal thoughts, it would be considered very common and receive a rating of 1.\n- If the response had mentioned that both can be used for recording daily events and experiences, along with the provided insight, it would fall under somewhat common and receive a rating of 2.\n- If the response had introduced a unique twist such as mentioning how both can be used as a means of communication with one's future self, it would be rated as very original and receive a rating of 4.\n- If the response had suggested a completely unexpected similarity such as viewing both as tools for dream analysis and interpretation, it would be rated as extremely original and receive a rating of 5.",
