They both form when the air becomes saturated with moisture and the water vapor condenses into tiny droplets.\n\nTeammate 3: I think another similarity is that both clouds and fog can obscure visibility. They can make it difficult to see things clearly, whether it's the sky above or objects on the ground.\n\nTeammate 4: And they can both change rapidly in appearance and shape. One moment a cloud or fog might look fluffy and light, and the next it could become thick and heavy.\n\nTeammate 5: I'd also add that both clouds and fog play a role in the water cycle. They help move water around the planet through processes like evaporation, condensation, and precipitation.\n\nTeammate 6: Additionally, clouds and fog can have different types and formations.

Fog can make it difficult to see things clearly on the ground, just like how clouds can block the sun or other objects in the sky.\n\nTeammate 3: I think both cloud and fog can also change in shape and size. Clouds can form and dissipate depending on weather conditions, much like how fog can roll in and out of an area.\n\nTeammate 4: Additionally, both cloud and fog can have different levels of density. Some clouds can be thick and dark, while others are light and fluffy. Similarly, fog can vary in thickness, with some areas being more dense than others.\n\nTeammate 5: Another way cloud and fog are alike is that they both play a role in the water cycle. Clouds can release rain or snow, while fog can contribute moisture to plants and soil through a process called fog drip.\n\nTeammate 1: That's a great point!
